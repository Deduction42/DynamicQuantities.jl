This defines a simple statically-typed `Quantity` type for Julia.
Physical dimensions are stored as a *value*, as opposed to a parametric type, as in [Unitful.jl](https://github.com/PainterQubits/Unitful.jl).
This is done to allow for calculations where physical dimensions are not known at compile time.

## Usage

You can create a `Quantity` object with a value and keyword arguments for the powers of the physical dimensions
(`mass`, `length`, `time`, `current`, `temperature`, `luminosity`, `amount`):

```julia
julia> x = Quantity(0.2, mass=1, length=0.5)
0.2 𝐋^(1//2) 𝐌^1

julia> y = Quantity(10.2, mass=2, time=-2)
10.2 𝐌^2 𝐓^(-2)
```

Elementary calculations with `+, -, *, /, ^, sqrt, cbrt` are supported:

```julia
julia> x * y
2.04 𝐋^(1//2) 𝐌^3 𝐓^(-2)

julia> x / y
0.019607843137254905 𝐋^(1//2) 𝐌^(-1) 𝐓^2

julia> x ^ 3
0.008000000000000002 𝐋^(3//2) 𝐌^3

julia> x ^ -1
5.0 𝐋^(-1//2) 𝐌^(-1)

julia> sqrt(x)
0.4472135954999579 𝐋^(1//4) 𝐌^(1//2)

julia> x ^ 1.5
0.0894427190999916 𝐋^(3//4) 𝐌^(3//2)
```

Each of these values has the same type, thus obviating the need for type inference at runtime.

Furthermore, we can do dimensional analysis automatically:

```julia
julia> x + 3 * x
0.8 𝐋^(1//2) 𝐌^1

julia> x + y
INVALID
```

We can see the second one has `valid(quantity) == false`. This doesn't throw an error by default, as it allows for stable return values.

The dimensions of a `Quantity` can be accessed either with `dimension(quantity)` for the entire `Dimensions` object:

```julia
julia> dimension(x)
𝐋^(1//2) 𝐌^1
```

or with `umass`, `ulength`, etc., for the various dimensions:

```julia
julia> umass(x)
1//1

julia> ulength(x)
1//2
```

Finally, you can strip units with `ustrip`:
    
```julia
julia> ustrip(x)
0.2
```

## Units

Despite the name, DynamicUnits does not actually work with units. Instead, it works with *dimensions*.
You can use Unitful to parse units, and use the DynamicUnits->Unitful extension for conversion:

```julia
julia> using Unitful: Unitful, @u_str

julia> x = 0.5u"km/s"
0.5 km s⁻¹

julia> y = convert(DynamicUnits.Quantity, x)
500.0 𝐋^1 𝐓^(-1)

julia> y2 = y^2 * 0.3
75000.0 𝐋^2 𝐓^(-2)

julia> x2 = convert(Unitful.Quantity, y2)
75000.0 m² s⁻²

julia> x^2*0.3 == x2
true
```

## Vectors

There is not a separate class for vectors, but you can create units
like so:

```julia
julia> randn(5) .* Dimensions(mass=2/5, length=2)
5-element Vector{Quantity{Float64}}:
 -0.72119725412798 𝐋^2 𝐌^(2//5)
 0.6443068291470538 𝐋^2 𝐌^(2//5)
 1.2137320667123697 𝐋^2 𝐌^(2//5)
 0.5125746727860678 𝐋^2 𝐌^(2//5)
 -0.6511788444561991 𝐋^2 𝐌^(2//5)
```

Because it is type stable, you can have mixed units in a vector too:

```julia
julia> v = [Quantity(randn(), mass=rand(0:5), length=rand(0:5)) for _=1:5]
5-element Vector{Quantity{Float64}}:
 0.6531745868307951 
 0.5260730397041357 𝐋^2 𝐌^5
 1.0827471975303913 𝐌^1
 1.5524518860763528 𝐌^1
 0.5376635007504901 𝐋^3 𝐌^1
```
